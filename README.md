# Aura

Phase 1 
- Shall set-up the Raspberry Pi and configure it for the project 
	- Shall install the Rasbian os 
	- Shall enable SPI and I2C i/o 
	- Shall install and setup the SW tools 
- Shall demonstrate basic understanding of Python coding 
	- Create simple unit conversion program 
		- 3 unit conversions 
			- C to F
			- h to s
			- m to ft
			- make them reversable (C->F ≈ F->C)
		- loops repeatedly until user chooses to quit
			- quit by typing "quit" or "q"
		- prompt the user for input 
		- prototype flowchart 
	- Need to create detailed requirements for your chosen program
- Shall demonstrate basic understanding of Raspberry Pi I/O 
	- Configure LED on breadboard 
		- configure pins on the GPIO 
			- pin #26 -> GND
	- Blink LED 
		- choose type of LED 
		- blink forever
		- blink every 2 seconds
		- 220Ω resistor
- Shall demonstrate basic understanding of Pygame 
	- Add a random rectangle to the center of the game screen 
		- decide on size, color, position 
		- decide on randomizer component 
	- Add random ball to the top-left corner of the game screen 
		- decide on size, color, position 
		- decide on randomizer component 
	- Add text to the top-right of the game screen 
		- decide on size, color, position, font, and text 
	- Pygame window
		- size and color
